            <p>Posted Feb. 17, 2015</p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT (THE &ldquo;AGREEMENT&rdquo;) CAREFULLY. THIS IS A BINDING, CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND SVMMIT, INC, ITS AFFILIATES OR AGENTS (&ldquo;BASH&rdquo;) AND APPLIES TO YOUR USE OF (I) ANY OF SVMMIT&rsquo;S PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR MOBILE DEVICES, INCLUDING ALL ENHANCEMENTS, VERSIONS, AND MODIFICATIONS TO THE FOREGOING (EACH, AN &ldquo;APPLICATION&rdquo;); AND (II) THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SVMMIT THROUGH THE APPLICATION AND/OR ANY SVMMIT WEBSITE (SUCH WEBSITE, THE &ldquo;WEBSITE&rdquo; AND THE PROVISION OF THE APPLICATION AND RELATED SERVICES, THE &ldquo;SERVICES&rdquo;) BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEBSITE, THE SOFTWARE, THE WIDGET, THE SERVICES OR APPLICATION, CLICKING ON THE &ldquo;I ACCEPT&rdquo; BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, AND/OR MERELY BROWSING THE WEBSITE, YOU REPRESENT THAT (1) YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, (2) YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT WITH SVMMIT, AND (3) YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT PERSONALLY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY YOU HAVE NAMED AS THE CUSTOMER, AND TO BIND THAT COMPANY TO THESE TERMS. THE TERM &ldquo;YOU&rdquo; REFERS TO THE INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY, AS APPLICABLE, IDENTIFIED AS THE CUSTOMER WHEN YOU REGISTERED ON THE WEBSITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES. IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THE SERVICES FOR A TERM (THE &ldquo;INITIAL TERM&rdquo;), THEN THE TERMS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED FOR ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE INITIAL TERM AT COMPANY&rsquo;S THEN-CURRENT FEE FOR SUCH SERVICES UNLESS YOU DECLINE TO RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 9.6 BELOW. THE TERMS OF USE REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your use of, and participation in, certain Services may be subject to additional terms (&ldquo;Supplemental Terms&rdquo;) and such Supplemental Terms will either be listed in these Terms of Use or will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up to use the supplemental Service. If these Terms of Use are inconsistent with such Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall control with respect to such Service. These Terms of Use and any applicable Supplemental Terms are referred to herein as the &ldquo;Terms.&rdquo; Some of the features and functions of the Services are limited to users of the Bash service and Application. You must be affiliated with a customer of Bash to have access to such features. Svmmit knows that your privacy is important. For this reason, we have created a privacy policy that describes our collection, use and disclosure practices regarding any personal information that you provide to us. The security of your personal information is important to us. While there is no such thing as &ldquo;perfect security&rdquo; on the Internet, we will take reasonable steps to help ensure the safety of your personal information. However, you understand and agree that such steps do not guarantee that the Website is invulnerable to all security breaches or immune from viruses, security threats or other vulnerabilities. We reserve the right to cooperate with local, state, provincial and national authorities in investigations of improper or unlawful activities and this may require the disclosure of your personal information.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY SVMMIT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AT ANY TIME.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When changes are made, Svmmit will make a new copy of the Terms of Use available at the Website and any new Supplemental Terms will be made available from within, or through, the affected Service on the Website. We will also update the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date at the top of these Terms of Use. If we make any material changes, and you have registered to use the Services, we will also send an e-mail to you at the last e-mail address you provided to us pursuant to these Terms. Any changes to these Terms will be effective immediately for new Users of the Website or Services and will be effective thirty (30) days after posting of notice of such changes on the Website for existing Users, provided that any material changes shall be effective for Users who have a registered account on the Website (each, a &ldquo;Registered User&rdquo;) upon the earlier of thirty (30) days after posting of notice of such changes on the Website or thirty (30) days after dispatch of an e-mail notice of such changes to Registered Users. Svmmit may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of the Website or the Services is permitted. If you do not agree to any change(s) after receiving a notice of such change(s), you shall stop using the Website and/or the Services. Otherwise, your continued use of the Website and/or Services constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">1. Use of the Services and Svmmit Materials. The Application, the Software, the Widget, and the information and content available on the Website and in the Services (as these terms are defined below) (collectively, the &ldquo;Svmmit Materials&rdquo;) are protected by copyright laws throughout the world. Subject to these Terms, Svmmit grants you a limited license to reproduce portions of the Svmmit Materials for the sole purpose of using the Services for your personal or non-commercial purposes. Unless otherwise specified by Svmmit in a separate license, your right to use any Svmmit Materials that you access or download through the Website, the Application, or the Services is subject to the Terms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">1.1 Application License. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Svmmit grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, revocable license to download, install and use a copy of Application(s) on a single mobile device or computer that you own or control and to run such copy of the Application solely for your own personal use or internal business purposes. Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an &ldquo;App Store Sourced Application&rdquo;) or from Svmmit&rsquo;s enterprise server, you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (i) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple&rsquo;s proprietary operating system) and (ii) as permitted by the &ldquo;Usage Rules&rdquo; set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">1.2 Software. Use of any software and associated documentation, other than the Application, that is made available via the Website or the Services (&ldquo;Software&rdquo;) is governed by the terms of the license agreement that accompanies or is included with the Software, or by the license agreement expressly stated on the Website page(s) accompanying the Software. These license terms may be posted with the Software downloads or at the Website page where the Software can be accessed. You shall not use, download or install any Software that is accompanied by or includes a license agreement unless you agree to the terms of such license agreement. At no time will Svmmit provide you with any tangible copy of our Software. Svmmit shall deliver access to the Software via electronic transfer or download and shall not use or deliver any tangible media in connection with the (a) delivery, installation, updating or problem resolution of any Software (including any new releases); or (b) delivery, correction or updating of documentation. For the purposes of this section tangible media shall include, but not be limited to, any tape disk, compact disk, card, flash drive, or any other comparable physical medium. Unless the accompanying license agreement expressly allows otherwise, any copying or redistribution of the Software is prohibited, including any copying or redistribution of the Software to any other server or location, or redistribution or use on a service bureau basis. If there is any conflict between the Terms and the license agreement, the license agreement shall take precedence in relation to that Software (except as provided in the following sentence). If the Software is a pre-release version, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary included within an accompanying license agreement, you are not permitted to use or otherwise rely on the Software for any commercial or production purposes. If no license agreement accompanies use of the Software, use of the Software will be governed by the Terms. Subject to your compliance with the Terms, Svmmit grants you a non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, revocable non-exclusive license to use the Software for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Services in the manner permitted by the Terms. Some Software may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">1.3 Use of Widgets. Our widgets are software tools that you may place on your website to permit your visitors to access our Website (each, a &ldquo;Widget&rdquo;). Widgets are only made available to subscribers of certain components of our Service. If you subscribe to a Service that includes the use of Widgets, then subject to your compliance with the Terms, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, revocable license to use and display the Widget on your website for your own personal or internal business purposes. You may not use the Widget for any other purpose without our prior written consent, and nothing in the Terms shall be deemed to grant you any right, title or interest in the Widget. In addition, you may not: (i) Use the Widget (or any content displayed in connection with or through it) in any manner that would constitute an endorsement by us of any product, service, activity or brand contained on your website; (ii) Place the Widget on any website that includes content that is offensive, harassing, threatening, abusive, discriminatory, vulgar, pornographic, or otherwise inappropriate, as determined by us in our sole discretion; or (iii) Use the Widget in any manner that prevents the end users of your website from linking directly to the application page of our Website. We reserve the right to discontinue providing any Widget at any time, or to direct you to cease displaying, or otherwise using, any Widget for any or no reason, without liability to you or any third party.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">1.4 Updates. You understand that the Website, the Application and the Services are evolving. As a result, Svmmit may require you to accept updates to the Website, the Application, or the Services that you have installed on your computer or mobile device. You acknowledge and agree that Svmmit may update the Website, the Application, and/or the Services with or without notifying you. You may need to update third party software from time to time in order to receive the Services or use the Website, the Application and/or the Software.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">1.5 Certain Restrictions. The rights granted to you in these Terms are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, reproduce, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit the Website or any portion of the Website, including any Svmmit Materials, (b) you shall not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other Svmmit Materials (including images, text, page layout or form) of Svmmit; (c) you shall not use any metatarsi or other &ldquo;hidden text&rdquo; using Svmmit&rsquo;s name or trademarks; (d) you shall not modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the Svmmit Materials except to the extent the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law; (e) you shall not use any manual or automated software, devices or other processes (including but not limited to spiders, robots, scrapers, crawlers, avatars, data mining tools or the like) to &ldquo;scrape&rdquo; or download data from any web pages contained in the Website; (f) access the Svmmit Materials in order to build a similar or competitive website, application or service; (g) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Svmmit Materials may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means; and (h) you shall not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in the Svmmit Materials. Any future release, update or other addition to the Svmmit Materials shall be subject to these Terms. Svmmit, its suppliers and service providers reserve all rights not granted in the Terms. Any unauthorized use of the Website, the Application, or the Services terminates the licenses granted by Svmmit pursuant to the Terms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">1.6 Third Party Materials. As a part of the Svmmit Materials, you may have access to materials that are hosted by another party. You agree that it is impossible for Svmmit to monitor such materials and that you access these materials at your own risk.</span>

You represent that you are entitled to grant Svmmit access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating Svmmit to pay any fees or making Svmmit subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third party service providers. By granting Svmmit access to any Third Party Accounts, you understand that Svmmit will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third Party Account (&ldquo;SNS Content&rdquo;) so that it is available on and through the Website and Services via your Account Unless otherwise specified in the Terms, all SNS Content shall be considered to be Your Content (as defined in Section 4.1) for all purposes of the Terms. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third Party Accounts will be available on and through your Account on the Website and Services. Please note that if a Third Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Svmmit&rsquo;s access to such Third Party Account is terminated by the third party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Website and Services.

You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or information, or on behalf of someone other than yourself. Svmmit reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to, claims by a third party that a username violates the third party&rsquo;s rights.

You acknowledge that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Website, the Application or the Services, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, including the Svmmit Materials (&ldquo;Content&rdquo;), are the sole responsibility of the party from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not Svmmit, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available (&ldquo;Make Available&rdquo;) through the Services, the Application, or the Website (&ldquo;Your Content&rdquo;), and other Users of the Services, and not Svmmit, are similarly responsible for all Content they Make Available through the Services, the Application, or the Website (&ldquo;User Content&rdquo;).</span>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">3.2 No Obligation to Pre-Screen Content. You acknowledge that Svmmit has no obligation to pre-screen Content (including, but not limited to, Your Content and User Content), although Svmmit reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or remove any Content. In the event that Svmmit pre-screens, refuses or removes any Content, you acknowledge that Svmmit will do so for Svmmit&rsquo;s benefit, not yours. Without limiting the foregoing, Svmmit shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the Terms or is otherwise objectionable.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">3.3 Storage. Svmmit has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or accuracy of any Content, including Your Content; the failure to store, transmit or receive transmission of Content; or the security, privacy, storage, or transmission of other communications originating with or involving use of the Services. Certain Services may enable you to specify the level at which such Services restrict access to Your Content. You are solely responsible for applying the appropriate level of access to Your Content. If you do not choose, the system may default to its most permissive setting. You agree that Svmmit retains the right to create reasonable limits on Svmmit&rsquo;s use and storage of the Content, including Your Content, such as limits on file size, storage space, processing capacity, and similar limits described in the web pages accompanying the Services and as otherwise determined by Svmmit in its sole discretion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">4. Ownership.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">4.2 Trademarks.

Before that scares you off, keep reading. We know these rights seem broad, but we are trying to cover all of the use cases for Your Content in one sentence &ndash; otherwise, this Agreement would be even longer. Don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; this does not mean that all Content you provide us will be made publicly available. We will use Your Content in accordance with the settings in which you submitted such Content, as detailed under our Privacy Policy. You also warrant that the holder of any worldwide intellectual property right, including moral rights, in Your Content, has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant the license stated above. You agree that you, not the Svmmit, are responsible for all of Your Content that you Make Available on or in the Website, or the Services, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted.</span>

You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to submit the Feedback. You hereby grant to Svmmit a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, and fully sub licensable right and license to use, reproduce, perform, display, distribute, adapt, modify, re-format, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any manner, any and all Feedback, and to sublicense the foregoing rights, in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Website, the Application, and the Services.</span>

Svmmit, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Website, Services, and Application, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g. product liability, legal compliance, or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the Application, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Application or Services. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Application is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store&rsquo;s terms and policies) when using the Application and the Services.

    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">8.1 User Responsibility. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users of the Services and any other parties with whom you interact through the Services; provided, however, that Svmmit reserves the right, but has no obligation, to intercede in such disputes.</span>

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: &ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not now or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9. Fees. We currently do not charge fees for the use of certain Applications and Services, although some of our Applications and/or Services in the future may charge fees.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9.1 General Purpose of Terms: Sale of Service, not Software. The purpose of the Terms is for you to secure access to the Services. All fees set forth within and paid by you under the Terms shall be considered solely in furtherance of this purpose. In no way are these fees paid considered payment for the sale, license, or use of the Software, and, furthermore, any use of the Software by you in furtherance of the Terms will be considered merely in support of the purpose of the Terms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9.2 Payment. You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You must provide Svmmit with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) or PayPal account (&ldquo;Payment Provider&rdquo;), or purchase order information as a condition to signing up for the Services. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card or PayPal account, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing Svmmit with your credit card number or PayPal account and associated payment information, you agree that Svmmit is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to Svmmit hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify Svmmit of any change in your billing address or the credit card or PayPal account used for payment hereunder. Svmmit reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on Svmmit Materials (including on an App Store) or by e-mail delivery to you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9.3 Service Subscription Fees. If you subscribe to a paid version of our Service, you will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee(s) for any Services (each, a &ldquo;Service Subscription Fee&rdquo;) at the time you create your Account and select your annual package (each, a &ldquo;Service Commencement Date&rdquo;). There are features of our Services that you can register for and use without paying a Subscription Fee. Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees for the Services are non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and Svmmit for the Services until Svmmit accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail, SNS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of communication.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9.4 Taxes. Svmmit&rsquo;s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Svmmit, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Svmmit for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, &ldquo;Sales Tax&rdquo; shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that Svmmit is permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9.5 Withholding Taxes. You agree to make all payments of fees to Svmmit free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to Svmmit will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide Svmmit with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9.6 Automatic Renewal. Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Terms. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a &ldquo;Renewal Commencement Date&rdquo;) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at Svmmit&rsquo;s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at any time prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by logging into and going to the &ldquo;Change/Cancel Membership&rdquo; page of your &ldquo;Account Settings&rdquo; page. If you do not wish your Account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please log in and go to the &ldquo;Change/Cancel Membership&rdquo; page on your &ldquo;Account Settings&rdquo; page. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize Svmmit to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if Svmmit does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that Svmmit may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9.7 Free Trials and Other Promotions. Any free trial or other promotion that provides Registered User level access to the Services must be used within the specified time of the trial. At the end of the trial period, your use of that Service will expire and any further use of the Service is prohibited unless you pay the applicable subscription fee. If you are inadvertently charged for a subscription, please contact Svmmit to have the charges reversed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9.8 Disputes. You must notify us in writing within seven (7) days after receiving your credit card statement, if you dispute any of our charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived. Billing disputes should be notified to the following address: Svmmit INC, 820 Broadway #151, Santa Monica, CA 90401, USA.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">10. Indemnification.

    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">17.8 Arbitration. (a) Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider (&ldquo;ADR Provider&rdquo;) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Agreement. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English; (3) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (4) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Svmmit may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. Please note that the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from California law, including the laws governing what can legally be sold, bought, exported, offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that are applicable to your use of the Website and the Services. (b) Any other Dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Commercial Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo;) and shall be administered by the Los Angeles office of JAMS (the &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo;). To the extent there is any conflict between the provisions set forth in this section and any procedural or other rules issued by the Administrator, this section will control. The location of the arbitration will be Los Angeles, CA. The Dispute(s) shall be submitted to a single arbitrator (&ldquo;Arbitrator&rdquo;) chosen by the parties or selected by the parties from a list of potential arbitrators provided by the Administrator. The Administrator shall provide such list to the parties 10 days after request by either party. Should the parties be unable to agree on a choice of arbitrator within 10 days after receipt of the list from the Administrator, then the Administrator will select the Arbitrator. The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English will be submitted in English translation accompanied by the original or true copy thereof. The English language version will control. Each party shall bear its own attorney&rsquo;s fees, costs, and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the Administrator and the Arbitrator; provided, however, the Arbitrator shall be authorized to determine whether a party is the prevailing party, and if so, to award to that prevailing party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, costs and disbursements (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges, travel expenses, etc.), and/or the fees and costs of the Administrator and the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The Arbitrator will not have authority to award damages in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 9 of this Agreement. Judgment on the award of the Arbitrators may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by California law or United States Federal law. (c) By using the Website, the Application, or the Services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration provision. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and Svmmit (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</span>
